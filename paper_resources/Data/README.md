# Paper Resources

Each sub-folder is separated into `Raw` and `Source` folders. The `Raw` folder contains the raw data, Python data processing code, and the relevant figures for paper publication. When the data processing code is run, the source data which can be used to immediately re-plot the figures is stored in the `Source` folder.
